        <div class="desc-bride">
          <p>We met at a work conference in February 2016. When Liisa introduced herself to the group she caught my eye. On the 24th of February, Liisa and Maarja (our Estonian colleague and good friend) got on stage on Estonia's Independence Day and shared some fun facts about their homeland: Free Wi-fi everywhere, lots of forest, Skype, most supermodels in the world...</p>
          <p>Needless to say, she had my attention at that point, but besides the facts, I was very attracted to the way she carried herself on stage.</p>
          <p>That evening a group of us met and went out to the town. It's fun to look back at the pictures because the obvious attraction jumps off the photo. Our body language tells the story. That weekend we made a few very bold declarations to each other. On the dancefloor. At a club. After drinking a lot of adult beverages.</p>
          <p>Fast forward two weeks, or so, and after meeting for a weekend in Gatlinburg, TN it was apparent that we had both found the person we'd marry. At least for me.</p>
          <p>I love that my Liisa cares about all of the right things. I've met a lot of people who are caring, attentive to detail and intentional but not in the way Liisa is. Of all the assumptions people would make about Liisa, at first glance, they'd never assume she spends less time on her appearance than on choosing the type of candy or ice cream she wants for a snack. Or that her desire to post a perfect picture with a meticulously crafted caption is motivated more by inspiring others than looking amazing. Liisa shows me a side of her that only I get to see and because of that she pulls that out of me. She's stronger and more capable than most and also quite vulnerable and innocent. Everything about Liisa is feminine energy at its purest form and for me that motivates me to be the type of man I'm capable of being. I don't hesitate to say she makes me better. I'm quick to admit she scares the hell out of me and I'm certain I'll do whatever I can for as long as I can to make her happy. She's a keeper.</p>

        <!--
        <div class="desc-groom">
          <p>When I saw Nick for the first time, I honestly thought (and still do every day), that he was the most handsome man I had ever seen in my life. Tall, dark-haired, brown-eyed, well-dressed, silky-smooth gentleman. I made some assumptions about him right away and being focused on a new chapter in my career, I considered him just an eye-candy for an intense work conference.</p>
          <p>I remember us making eye contact when passing during that Coaches Camp. Nick recalls me turning several times completely around to look at him. Must have been my subconscious working for me!</p>
          <p>On Thursday that week we had our first conversation. During lunch we talked about fitness and he shared an embarrassing story about his first public speaking appearance. I was drawn to his confidence, manliness and manners.
  </p>
          <p>In the next following days we spent together I understood, that the first labels I had put on him, were totally wrong and I started to understand, that this could really be a start of something big. After we had known each other for two weeks I was doing my visionboard. I put the only picture that we had at that point, that was just the two of us, on it and decided- he'll be a part of my vision.</p>
          <p>I appreciate that Nick has always made me feel secure and loved. He has the type of presence, that no one else does, captivating every person's attention in the room he walks in. Of all the assumptions people would make about Nick, they'd never assume that under his masculine, strong body and confident, well-carried shell is a big, sweet goof, who makes me laugh every day. Just like under his perfectly polished hair is a curly afro:) Or that his determination to succeed is more driven by the will to provide incredible memories to the people closest to him, than by satisfying his own ego. Nick doesn't take himself or the world too seriously and reminds me to enjoy every moment that we are in. He balances my impatience with calmness, my over-planning with spontaneity, my worrying with faith and my messiness with his precision. He is passionate and doesn't give up on a thought if he already sees it in reality, just like he did with his idea of me walking down the isle towards him. I know he was made for me and I plan to always give my very best to be the reason behind his smiles.
